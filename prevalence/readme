Three R scripts are provided in this folder: 

- KalmanFunctions.R -> functions implementing the SAEM algorithm combined with Kalman filtering techniques.

- ModelFunctions.R  -> functions used to compute some key quantities related to the SIR model.

- SIRexample.R      -> examples of the SIR model: simulation of random parameters and jump processes, generation of the observations and application of the SAEM_KM function.
